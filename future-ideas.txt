What I want to add in the future:

    Smaller picture:
        - make a settings button and move change background color there

    Bigger picture:
        - make more options and better popup when clicking on a node
        - make it so user doesn't have to keep downloading new files for every save
        - make better starting page (menu)(maybe)
        - update visuals
        - make it so you can dettach and reattach nodes to each other
