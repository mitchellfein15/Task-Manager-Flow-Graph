What I want to add in the future:

    Smaller picture:
        - need to fix it so that the labels have the same animation as the buttons
        - need to make physics better. The nodes that aren't attached are pushing each other way too much

    Bigger picture:
        - make more options and better popup when clicking on a node
        - make it so user doesn't have to keep downloading new files for every save
        - make better starting page (menu)(maybe)
        - update visuals
